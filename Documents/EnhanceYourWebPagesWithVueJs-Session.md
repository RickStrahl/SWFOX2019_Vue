# Enhance your Web Pages with VueJs

VueJS is the latest in a long line of popular JavaScript client side frameworks libraries that aim to make it easier to build rich Web applications. Vue sets itself apart being smaller and simpler than most other full Single Page Application (SPA) frameworks like Angular and React, and—maybe more importantly—can be integrated into existing Web sites without a complicated build process. Vue allows for easy drop-in integration and progressive enhancements to existing static or server generated Web content without forcing developers into fully client side SPA applications. But Vue also supports a full SPA framework using the same tools that you may have seen in the other frameworks, which provides a richer model for creating components and composing of complex SPA applications.

In this session, I'll demonstrate the basics of Vue in plain Web pages using standard ES5 JavaScript code that we're all familiar with to start with by adding some rich data binding features to an existing HTML page. I'll demonstrate the core features of Vue including models, data binding and messaging using these simple examples. We then look at creating a small application using a full SPA model using the Vue CLI and using the full build process that is provided through the Vue CLI. The features demonstrated are generic and mostly work with HTML content only, but I'll also provide a server REST service using Web Connection to provide FoxPro data to one of the samples.

You will learn:

- What Vue is and how it is different than other frameworks
- How to integrate Vue into existing Web content using standard ES5 JavaScript
- How to create full SPA applications using the Vue CLI
- How to consume server data from the Web Browser
